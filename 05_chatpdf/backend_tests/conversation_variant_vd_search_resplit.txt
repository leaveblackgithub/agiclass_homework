2. Llama 2-Chat, a ﬁne-tuned version of Llama 2 that is optimized for dialogue use cases. We release variants of this model with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters as well. We believe that the open release of LLMs, when done safely, will be a net beneﬁt to society.
Our ﬁne-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based onour human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed source models.
In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a family of pretrained and ﬁne-tuned LLMs, Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, at scales up to 70B parameters. On the series of helpfulness and safety benchmarks we tested, Llama 2-Chat models generally perform better than existing open-source models.
We also share novel observations we made during the development of Llama 2 and Llama 2-Chat, such as the emergence of tool usage and temporal organization of knowledge. Figure 3: Safety human evaluation results for Llama 2-Chat compared to other open-source and closed source models.
Following this, we create an initial version of Llama 2-Chat through the application of supervised ﬁne-tuning.
